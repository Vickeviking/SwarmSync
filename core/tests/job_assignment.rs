== 🛠️ CRUD ==
• POST   /assignments                    → Create new assignment (NewJobAssignment) → 201 Created (JobAssignment)
• GET    /assignments/:id               → Fetch assignment by ID → 200 OK (JobAssignment)
• DELETE /assignments/:id               → Delete assignment by ID → 204 No Content

== 🔍 Lookup & Search ==
• GET /assignments/by_job/:job_id                  → Assignments by Job ID → 200 OK (Vec<JobAssignment>)
• GET /assignments/by_worker/:worker_id            → Assignments by Worker ID → 200 OK (Vec<JobAssignment>)
• GET /assignments/lookup/:job_id/:worker_id       → Assignment by Job + Worker → 200 OK (Option<JobAssignment>)
• GET /assignments/by_worker/range?worker_id&start&end
                                                  → Assignments in time range for worker → 200 OK (Vec<JobAssignment>)
• GET /assignments/active                          → Currently active assignments → 200 OK (Vec<JobAssignment>)

== 🔄 State Transitions ==
• PATCH /assignments/:id/started   → Mark assignment as started (NaiveDateTime) → 200 OK (JobAssignment)
• PATCH /assignments/:id/finished  → Mark assignment as finished (NaiveDateTime) → 200 OK (JobAssignment)
